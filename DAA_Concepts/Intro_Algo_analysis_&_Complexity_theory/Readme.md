# What is Algorithm ?

## 

## an algorithm is a finite set of well-defined instructions which solve a specific problem or perform particular task.

### 

### Example:- Imagine you want to build a tower with your toy blocks. 🧱

### 

### Remember⚠️ An algorithm is like a set of instructions Which gives by your family(Mom \& Dad).

### They might say:

### 

```
### 1\. First, get the big green block.

### 2\. Then, put the yellow block on top of it.

### 3\. Next, put the small red block on top of that.
```
### 

### Tada! ✨ You built a tower!

### 

### Those steps 1, 2, 3 are your algorithm. It's just a simple list of steps to get something done.

## Computers need algorithms for **everything**! To play a game, to show a movie, or to do math, we have to give them a list of steps to follow. They just follow the steps, just like you followed the steps to build your tower! 😊


## Key Characteristics of Algorithms
   _> [!NOTE]
   _ **Input**: It must have zero or more well-defined inputs.
   _ **Output**: It must have one or more well-defined outputs.
   _**Finiteness**: It must terminate after a finite number of steps.
   _**Definiteness**: Each steps must be clear and unambiguous, leaving no room for ambiguity or error.
   _**Effectiveness**: Every instruction must be basic enough that it can be carried out, in principle, by a person using only a pen and paper.
